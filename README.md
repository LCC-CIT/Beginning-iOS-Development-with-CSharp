# Beginning-iOS-Development-with-CSharp
The iOS apps in this repository were translated into C# from examples in the book *Beginning iPhone Development with Swift*, 
by David Mark , Jack Nutting , Kim Topley , Fredrik Olsson , Jeff LaMarche, and published by Apress in 2014.

The code was written using Xamarin Studio and requires the Xamarin.iOS library and license.

These apps were translated for use with a class I teach at Lane Community College, 
CS235IM, Intermediate Mobile Applications Development: iOS.
