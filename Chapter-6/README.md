### Chapter 6: ViewSwticher
This project uses just code (no NavigationController or Segue) to switch between two views, a blue view and a red view.


Note: This app is just one app in the Beginning-iOS-Development-with-CSharp repository. To get the source code for this app you will need to clone or download the entire repository.

This demo was written for CS235IM, Mobile App Development:iOS, at Lane Community College.
